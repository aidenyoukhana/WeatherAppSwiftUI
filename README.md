WeatherAppSwiftUI
      **1** This is an awesome weather app that was built using Xcode and iOS native programming languages: swift.
      **2** In this project, I have created a static weather app that is ready for a dynamic implementation using the various APIs. 
      **3** Used various methods for stacking and implementing the different viewes: ZStack, VStack, and HStack.
      **4** Created a button that helped the user to switch from the dark to light mode.
      **5** Used a @State variables throughout the project.
      **6** Used a @Binding variables to change that status of the modes.
      **7** A linear gradient coloring system was used to design the light mode of the background view.
